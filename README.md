# TestingConfigs
Used as a sandbox for configurations and docs before they are production ready.

Hi there!
Chances are you found this page because we're talking about a configuration for something like Network UPS Tools, some SNMP or RESTful API monitoring, or some other similar Tripp Lite UPS/PDU configuration. Alternatively, a web search may have gotten you here. Hopefully, this information proves useful, but please note:

**The information here is NOT intended for production use, may be incorrect, have bugs, or be incomplete. If you have questions, please reach out to me, but do NOT consider anything here ready-to-use as-is without testing/verification**
